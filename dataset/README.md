by Yicheng Wu*+, Xiangde Luo+, Zhe Xu, Xiaoqing Guo, Lie Ju, Zongyuan Ge, Wenjun Liao and Jianfei Cai.

We use the pre-processed LIDC-IDRI dataset as [MedicalMatting](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-87199-4_54), which can be found at [here](https://github.com/wangsssky/MedicalMatting/tree/main/dataset).

For the NPC-170 dataset, we open the [MMIS-2024](https://mmis2024.vercel.app/) challenge in ACM MM 2024. The training and validation sets are available now.

If you want to use the NPC-170 dataset, please consider citing:
